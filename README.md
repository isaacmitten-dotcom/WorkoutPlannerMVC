## Week 10 Modeling summary

This week's goal was to create the Workout and Exercise models that I will be using for the rest of the project and define their data structure and relationship. The properties for the Workout entity are name, start date, description, and a list of exercises. The properties for the exercise entity are name, description, reps, sets, a foreign key, and a workout entity. The relationship between the Workout entity and the Exercise entity is one-to-many, where one workout has many exercises.  After creating the models, I created the WorkoutPlannerMVCContext, which has data sets for the Workout and Exercise entities. I created the one-to-many relationship using Fluent AI in the model builder like this: 

`modelBuilder.Entity<Workout>()
    .HasMany(w => w.Exercises)
    .WithOne(e => e.Workout)
    .HasForeignKey(e => e.WorkoutId);`


    
I then made the migration titled InitMigration to initialize the database schema. I scaffolded the view and controllers so that I could ensure the one-to-many relationship was created correctly. That view ended up looking like this:

I would like to note that the CRUD operations created during this process are not finished, and they were just created to help ensure the entities' relationship was correct. The focus this week was solely on creating the entities, DB context, and the migration. The CRUD operations will be completed at a later week.
